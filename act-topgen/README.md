# ACT Topology Generation

This role generates ACT topology files based on AVD structured config files.

The default is to look for structured configs in ./intended/structured_configs/ and output the result to ./act/

You have to build an AVD project first and run the eos_designs role to build the structured configs before this role can be used.

## Example Playbook

Use the same top level group you have for your fabric for hosts, modify the input variables to the role to make the topology you want.

```yaml
---
- name: Build ACT Topology
  hosts: ACT_FABRIC
  connection: local
  gather_facts: false

  tasks:
    - name: Generate ACT Topology File
      import_role:
        name: act-topgen
```

## Role Defaults
